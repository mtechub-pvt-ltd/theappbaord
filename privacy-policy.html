        <h1>Privacy Policy (UK)</h1>
        <div class="caption">Last updated: [DD Month YYYY]</div>
        <p><strong>Who we are:</strong> <strong>[Company Legal Name]</strong>, trading as <strong>[Product/Brand, e.g.,
                “AttributionOS”]</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”). Registered address: <strong>[Address]</strong>. ICO
            registration no.: <strong>[if available]</strong>. Contact: <a
                href="mailto:privacy@yourdomain">[privacy@yourdomain]</a>.</p>
        <p>This policy explains how we handle personal data when you: (a) visit our websites and marketing pages, (b)
            create an account and use our SaaS platform and dashboard, and (c) interact with our support or sales teams.
            It covers the product described in your PRD.</p>

        <h2>1) Our role</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Controller:</strong> We act as a <em>controller</em> for data about our customers and users of
                the platform (e.g., account, billing, usage, support).</li>
            <li><strong>Processor:</strong> We act as a <em>processor</em> for our customers when we process their
                end-user/event data solely to provide the analytics services. A Data Processing Addendum (DPA) is
                available on request.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) Personal data we collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account &amp; Billing:</strong> name, email, company, role, authentication data, subscription
                plan, invoices and payment status (payments handled by <strong>[Stripe/…]</strong>, we do not store full
                card details).</li>
            <li><strong>Product &amp; Event Data (processor):</strong> campaign and attribution signals (e.g., UTM
                parameters, ad click IDs such as <code>gclid</code>/<code>fbclid</code>), device and network metadata
                (IP address, user-agent, referrer), in-app/website events you choose to track (installs, conversions,
                revenue events), and identifiers you send (e.g., hashed user ID). We instruct customers
                <strong>not</strong> to send special category data.</li>
            <li><strong>Logs &amp; Telemetry:</strong> service logs, diagnostics, security logs.</li>
            <li><strong>Support &amp; Sales:</strong> messages, call notes, and attachments you share with us.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies/SDK-less tracking on our sites:</strong> see <strong>Cookies &amp; similar
                    technologies</strong> below.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) Purposes &amp; lawful bases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide and secure the service</strong> (create your account, serve dashboards, prevent abuse) —
                <em>Contract</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Billing, tax, and records</strong> — <em>Contract / Legal obligation</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Product improvement, troubleshooting, and analytics</strong> — <em>Legitimate interests</em> (we
                balance these against your rights).</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing (emails/ads) on our own sites</strong> — <em>Consent</em> where required; you can
                withdraw at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies &amp; similar tech</strong> — <em>Consent</em> for non-essential cookies; essential
                cookies run without consent. ICO guidance requires clear information and prior consent for non-essential
                cookies under PECR. (<a
                    href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                    target="_blank">ICO</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Cookies &amp; similar technologies</h2>
        <p>We use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential cookies</strong> for core site and security (no consent required).</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics/Performance</strong> and <strong>Advertising</strong> cookies only with your consent
                via our banner/preferences center. You can change or withdraw consent at any time. This flows from PECR
                and ICO guidance on cookies and consent. (<a
                    href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                    target="_blank">ICO</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5) Sharing your data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service providers/sub-processors</strong> under contract (e.g., cloud hosting, databases,
                logging/monitoring, email delivery, payment processing, customer support tools).</li>
            <li><strong>Professional advisors</strong> (legal, accounting), <strong>law enforcement</strong> when
                required by law, and <strong>corporate transaction</strong> counterparties (if we sell/merge assets). We
                maintain a current list of sub-processors at <strong>[URL]</strong> and require appropriate safeguards
                and confidentiality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6) International transfers</h2>
        <p>If we transfer UK personal data outside the UK (e.g., to the US or other countries), we use legal transfer
            tools such as the <strong>UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA)</strong> or the <strong>UK
                Addendum</strong> to the EU SCCs, and perform transfer risk assessments where needed. (<a
                href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                target="_blank">ICO</a>)</p>

        <h2>7) Data retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customer/account data:</strong> kept while your account is active and for up to <strong>[6
                    years]</strong> afterward for tax, accounting, and dispute purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Event data (processor):</strong> default retention <strong>[e.g., 24 months]</strong>
                (configurable by the customer).</li>
            <li><strong>Logs:</strong> <strong>[e.g., 90–180 days]</strong> unless extended for security investigations.
                We delete or anonymise data after these periods unless we must keep it longer by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8) Security</h2>
        <p>We apply technical and organisational measures including encryption in transit and at rest, access controls,
            least-privilege permissions, environment isolation, continuous monitoring, and employee training. Customers
            are responsible for securing their own credentials, API keys, and data sent into the platform.</p>

        <h2>9) Your rights (UK GDPR)</h2>
        <p>Subject to conditions and exemptions, you have the right to: <strong>be informed; access; rectify; erase;
                restrict; object; data portability;</strong> and, where processing is based on consent, <strong>withdraw
                consent at any time</strong>. You also have the right to <strong>complain to the ICO</strong> (see
            contact below). (<a
                href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"

        <p>How to exercise your rights: email <a href="mailto:privacy@yourdomain">[privacy@yourdomain]</a>. We will
            respond within <strong>one month</strong> and may request verification of identity.</p>

        <h2>10) Children</h2>
        <p>Our services are <strong>not directed to children</strong> and are intended for business users. In the UK,
            children <strong>under 13</strong> cannot consent to online services; parental consent would be required. We
            do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data to us,
            contact <a href="mailto:privacy@yourdomain">[privacy@yourdomain]</a> to request deletion. (<a

        <h2>11) Automated decision-making</h2>
        <p>We do not make decisions producing legal or similarly significant effects solely by automated means. If this
            changes, we will explain the logic involved and your rights related to such processing.</p>

        <h2>12) When we act as a processor</h2>
        <p>When customers send us end-user/event data, we process it <strong>only</strong> under their instructions, to
            provide the analytics service, troubleshoot, and maintain security. Customers are responsible for providing
            their own privacy notices to end users and establishing a lawful basis (e.g., consent for non-essential
            cookies/tags, or other lawful bases for server-side events). We offer a <strong>DPA</strong> that includes
            data-security terms, confidentiality, sub-processor controls, international transfer mechanisms, and
            deletion on termination.</p>

        <h2>13) Third-party links</h2>
        <p>Our sites and dashboards may contain links to third-party sites. Their privacy practices are their own;
            review their policies before providing data.</p>

        <h2>14) Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in law, guidance, or our services. We’ll post updates here and
            change the “Last updated” date. Where appropriate, we’ll notify you by email or in-app.</p>

        <h2>15) Contact &amp; UK complaints</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@yourdomain">[privacy@yourdomain]</a></li>
            <li><strong>Mail:</strong> [Company Legal Name, Address]</li>
            <li><strong>ICO:</strong> You can raise a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). See
                “UK GDPR guidance and resources / Right to be informed and individual rights” on the ICO site for how to
                do this. (<a
