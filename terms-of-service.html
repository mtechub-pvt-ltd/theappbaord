        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
        <div class="caption">Last updated: [DD Month YYYY]</div>
        <p><strong>Company:</strong> [Company Legal Name], trading as [Product/Brand] (“we”, “us”, “our”). Registered in
            [jurisdiction] at [address]. Contact: <a href="mailto:legal@yourdomain">[legal@yourdomain]</a>.</p>

        <h2>1) What these terms cover</h2>
        <p>These Terms govern access to and use of [Product] (the “Service”), our websites, and related materials, along
            with ordering, billing, renewal, and cancellation.</p>

        <h2>2) Who is the customer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business customers (B2B):</strong> the company or sole trader creating the account.</li>
            <li><strong>Consumers (B2C):</strong> an individual acting wholly or mainly outside their trade/profession.
                Some consumer-only rights apply (see §11, §16). The Consumer Rights Act 2015 covers contracts for
                services and digital content. (<a
                    href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/notes/division/2?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                    target="_blank">Legislation.gov.uk</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) Account & authorised users</h2>
        <p>You must provide accurate account details, keep credentials secure, and ensure your users comply with these
            Terms. You’re responsible for actions under your account.</p>

        <h2>4) Ordering, plans, auto-renewal</h2>
        <p>You select a plan in the admin/billing area. Subscriptions <strong>auto-renew</strong> for the same term
            unless cancelled per §10. We’ll show pricing before purchase and taxes where applicable. The UK is
            introducing a new subscription regime to strengthen cancellation/renewal transparency—our flows are designed
            to comply as those rules come into force. (<a

                href="https://www.lewissilkin.com/en/insights/2024/09/12/our-guide-digital-markets-competition-consumers-bill-focusing-consumer-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                target="_blank">lewissilkin.com</a>)</p>

        <h2>5) Fees & payment</h2>
        <p>Fees are due in advance by card/online payment. You authorise recurring charges until you cancel. Late or
            failed payments may lead to suspension. You’re responsible for currency conversion fees and applicable
            taxes.</p>

        <h2>6) No refunds</h2>
        <p>We <strong>do not offer refunds</strong> for amounts already paid (including partial periods). Cancellations
            stop <strong>future</strong> renewals only. This does not affect statutory remedies for consumers or billing
            errors (see §11, §12). (Pair this with your Refund Policy.)</p>

        <h2>7) Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>Don’t: break the law; infringe IP; upload harmful code; attempt to bypass security; send spam; or
            misrepresent data subject consents. We may suspend for violations.</p>

        <h2>8) Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>We (and our licensors) own the Service and all related IP. You own your <strong>Customer Data</strong> and
            grant us a limited licence to use it to operate, improve, and secure the Service. We may use
            anonymised/aggregated data for analytics and benchmarking.</p>

        <h2>9) Data protection</h2>
        <p>We are <strong>controller</strong> for account/billing/support data and <strong>processor</strong> for
            end-user/event data processed on your instructions. Our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> and <strong>Data
                Processing Addendum (DPA)</strong> apply (including international transfer tools and sub-processor
            list). Cookies and similar tech on our marketing sites follow UK PECR/ICO guidance on consent. (<a
                href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                target="_blank">Information Commissioner's Office</a>)</p>

        <h2>10) Cancellation & termination</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You can cancel anytime</strong> in <strong>Settings → Billing</strong>; cancellation takes
                effect at the end of the current term.</li>
            <li>We may terminate for material breach (including non-payment) after notice and a reasonable cure period.
            </li>
            <li>On termination, we’ll delete or return Customer Data per the DPA/Privacy Policy and your export tools.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11) Consumer rights (B2C only)</h2>
        <p>If you buy as a <strong>consumer</strong> online, you usually have a <strong>14-day</strong> cooling-off
            period from contract. If you ask us to start supply immediately, you acknowledge this may <strong>limit or
                remove</strong> the right to cancel for digital content once supply begins; and for service elements
            started within 14 days we may charge a <strong>proportionate</strong> amount. We follow the <strong>Consumer
                Contracts Regulations 2013</strong> timelines and disclosures. (<a
                href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/3134/regulation/30?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                target="_blank">Legislation.gov.uk</a>)</p>

        <h2>12) Billing errors</h2>
        <p>We’ll refund <strong>duplicate/erroneous</strong> charges we caused once verified. Disputed card chargebacks
            may trigger account suspension while we investigate.</p>

        <h2>13) Warranties (service standard)</h2>
        <p>We’ll provide the Service with <strong>reasonable care and skill</strong>. The Service is otherwise provided
            “as is” and “as available”; we don’t guarantee it will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that it fits your
            particular purpose. Consumer statutory rights under the <strong>Consumer Rights Act 2015</strong> remain.
            (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/notes/division/2?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                target="_blank">Legislation.gov.uk</a>)</p>

        <h2>14) Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability for <strong>death or personal injury caused by
                negligence</strong>, or <strong>fraud/fraudulent misrepresentation</strong>. To the extent permitted by
            law, we’re not liable for indirect or consequential losses, loss of profits, revenues, data, or business
            interruption. Our total liability for all claims in a subscription term is capped at the fees you paid for
            that term. (Note: UK law prohibits excluding liability for death/personal injury by negligence.) (<a

        <h2>15) Service changes</h2>
        <p>We may update features, interfaces, or usage limits. Material changes will be announced in-app or by email.
            If a change materially reduces core functionality you rely on, you may cancel before the next renewal.</p>

        <h2>16) Trials, promotions, and subscriptions</h2>
        <p>Trials or promo pricing convert to paid plans unless cancelled before the end of the trial/promo. We provide
            clear renewal information and simple cancellation routes consistent with the UK’s developing subscription
            rules and CMA guidance. (<a

        <h2>17) Third-party services</h2>
        <p>Integrations and links to third-party services are subject to their terms. We’re not responsible for those
            services.</p>

        <h2>18) Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>Each party must keep the other’s non-public information confidential and use it only to perform these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>19) Force majeure</h2>
        <p>Neither party is liable for delays/failures caused by events beyond reasonable control (e.g., outages, acts
            of government, disasters), provided the affected party uses reasonable efforts to mitigate.</p>

        <h2>20) Governing law & venue</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>England &amp; Wales</strong>. Courts of <strong>England &amp;
                Wales</strong> have exclusive jurisdiction, except that consumers may bring claims in their local UK
            courts where required by law.</p>

        <h2>21) Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms to reflect law or product changes. We’ll post updates and adjust the “Last updated”
            date; for material changes, we’ll notify you in-app or by email before they take effect.</p>
